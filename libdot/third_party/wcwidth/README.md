## Updating

When a new [Unicode release](http://www.unicode.org/versions/latest/) is made,
it might contain new combining and wide characters, so we'll need to update our
tables.  The [uniset utility](./uniset) can be used in some cases to generate
lookup tables.

You'll first want to grab the latest Unicode release.  It's easiest to grab
the entire archive (it's small) and then extract the few files you want.
The `UNIDATA` path below is really a symlink to the latest version.
```
$ wget http://www.unicode.org/Public/UNIDATA/UCD.zip
$ unzip -u UCD.zip EastAsianWidth.txt PropList.txt UnicodeData.txt
```

Then use the helper script to update the tables in [lib_wc.js](./lib_wc.js).
```
$ ./ranges.py update
```

Now you'll double check the update to make sure things look sane.  G'luck!
