# Embedding hterm

This is a quick overview describing how to use hterm in your own application.
Please direct any questions to the [chromium-hterm mailing list].

[chromium-hterm mailing list]: https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/chromium-hterm

## Get the code

The "libapps" git repository contains hterm and its dependencies.
Clone this repo into a parent directory of your choice.
In this example we'll create `~/src/libapps/`:

```sh
$ mkdir ~/src
$ cd ~/src
$ git clone https://chromium.googlesource.com/apps/libapps
```

## Build hterm

The build process bundles some resources as JavaScript source and concatenates
the JavaScript into a single file (`hterm_all.js`).

```sh
$ cd ~/src/libapps
$ ./hterm/bin/mkdist.sh
```

The files are all written to `./hterm/dist/js/`.  Copy the `hterm_all.js` file
into your project.

## Include hterm in your app

Include the generated `hterm_all.js` file in your app in an appropriate manner.
This step should be self evident.

## Initialize hterm

### Terminal node

You'll want a sacrificial DOM node which will become the terminal widget.
It should be a div which is either `position: relative` or `position: absolute`.

In our example, we'll assume this DOM:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <body>
    <div id="terminal"
         style="position:relative; width:100%; height:100%"></div>
  </body>
</html>
```

### Runtime storage

You'll need to choose a storage implementation.
This is the backing store that hterm will use to read and write preferences.
This should be one of:

```js
// If you are a cross-browser web app and want to use window.localStorage.
hterm.defaultStorage = new lib.Storage.Local();

// If you are a cross-browser web app and want in-memory storage only.
hterm.defaultStorage = new lib.Storage.Memory();

// If you are a Chrome app and want sync storage.
hterm.defaultStorage = new lib.Storage.Chrome(chrome.storage.sync);

// If you are a Chrome app and want local storage.
hterm.defaultStorage = new lib.Storage.Chrome(chrome.storage.local);
```

### Terminal initialization

Create an instance of `hterm.Terminal`:

```js
// opt_profileName is the name of the terminal profile to load, or "default" if
// not specified.  If you're using one of the persistent storage
// implementations then this will scope all preferences read/writes to this
// name.
const t = new hterm.Terminal(opt_profileName);
```

Now write an `onTerminalReady` handler.
This will fire once, when the terminal is initialized and ready for use.

```js
t.onTerminalReady = function() {
  // Create a new terminal IO object and give it the foreground.
  // (The default IO object just prints warning messages about unhandled
  // things to the the JS console.)
  const io = t.io.push();

  io.onVTKeystroke = (str) => {
    // Do something useful with str here.
    // For example, Secure Shell forwards the string onto the NaCl plugin.
  };

  io.sendString = (str) => {
    // Just like a keystroke, except str was generated by the terminal itself.
    // For example, when the user pastes a string.
    // Most likely you'll do the same thing as onVTKeystroke.
  };

  io.onTerminalResize = (columns, rows) => {
    // React to size changes here.
    // Secure Shell pokes at NaCl, which eventually results in
    // some ioctls on the host.
  };

  // You can call io.push() to foreground a fresh io context, which can
  // be uses to give control of the terminal to something else.  When that
  // thing is complete, should call io.pop() to restore control to the
  // previous io object.
};
```

After you've registered your onTerminalReady handler you can connect the
terminal to the sacrificial DOM node.

```js
t.decorate(document.querySelector('#terminal'));
```

### Keyboard setup

After you call the `decorate` helper, you'll usually call `installKeyboard`
to capture all keyboard input when the terminal is focused.
This allows us to react to keyboard shortcuts and such.

```js
t.installKeyboard();
```

## Write to the terminal

Once `onTerminalReady` finishes, you're free to start writing content!
This is the process or connection that wants to display content to the user
(rather than the user sending content).

```js
t.io.print('Print a string without a newline');
t.io.println('Print a string and add CRLF');
```

You usually want to go through the `io` object to display content rather than
going directly through the terminal.  It will take care of encoding UTF-16 to
UTF-8 and then sending it via `t.interpret` (which processes escape sequences).
If you use the `t.print` function directly, it won't do either of those things,
which might be what you want.
